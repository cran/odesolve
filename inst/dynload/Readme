The directories contain a simple example, in both C and Fortran, of
using a compiled function definition with lsoda().  In order to use
this feature, you must be able to compile a source package.  To run
the examples, first change to the directory specific to the language
(C or Fortran) you want to use.  You must have write-access to that
directory (so, you might need to copy the files to another
directory).  Issue the command to create the dll.  On UNIX, it is
(assuming you are working in the C subdirectory:

R CMD SHLIB mymod.c

Then, 

R --slave < testdynload.R

will run the example.  Of course, the main point is to read the source
code!
